# Hi there! 👋 I'm Aigerim

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a **Computer Science Master's student** with a strong passion for **data analytics, machine learning, and NLP**. My journey has taken me through academic research, real-world projects, and self-driven learning to bridge the gap between theory and practical applications.

🔹 Currently, I'm diving deep into **time series modeling** and **business financial data analysis**.

🔹 I have experience working with **Machine Learning Algorithms, NLP, SQL, Python, and Power BI**, and I'm actively improving my skills through hands-on projects.

## 💼 Projects & Experience
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### 📊 Time Series Analysis & Business Data
- **Hotel Demand & Revenue Analysis** 📉: Modeled hotel demand and profitability using financial and economic data before and during COVID-19, focusing on time series modeling and forecasting using Linear Regression, Bass models, and ARIMA models.

### 🤖 Machine Learning & NLP
- **Comparison of Pretrained Models on Newspaper Summarization and Sentiment Analysis** 📰: Evaluated BART, T5, Pegasus, and BERT for text summarization and sentiment analysis, achieving superior performance with BART for summarization and VADER for sentiment classification.
- **Python Static Type Checker** 🐍: Developed a static type checker for Python using JFlex, CUP, and TypeScript, integrating it into a VS Code extension.
- **Optical Coherence Tomography Image Segmentation** 👁️: Trained CNN-based models (2D-UNET, 3D-UNET) for retina layer segmentation, optimizing precision with Dice+BCE loss function.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, R
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning & NLP**: TensorFlow, Keras, Gensim, NLTK, SpaCy
